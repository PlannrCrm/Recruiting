# We're recruiting!

We're on the hunt for a handful of developers to come join the fun at Plannr and help build something truly industry changing! 

## About us
Plannr Technologies Limited is a new business formed of over 14 years experience building data-driven tools for the financial industry through our sister business Codepotato Limited. We created Plannr as a dedicated home for all of our innovative tools for financial professionals and the first project we have tackled is a modern CRM with industry leading functionality like our automation engine. We've already picked up an award for our innovative approach too! 

We're all about building truly modern tech collaboratively with the financial advice industry. 

## Open Roles

- Laravel Developers
- VueJS Developers

### Laravel Developer Roles

We're looking for a handful of passionate developers who love the art of craft and enjoy nothing more than creating incredible projects with their own fair hands (and code, obviously!). As a team we're big lovers of Laravel and have built several APIs that power our own industry-changing CRM as well as other products of ours. 

We're always looking for developers who have the following: 
- A passion for building awesome products
- Experienced with GIT to the point that creating a pull request or dealing with merge conflicts doesn't scare you!
- A minimum of 3 years experience working with Laravel
- Experience working with APIs (or building them!)
- Confident in (or keen to learn) unit and feature testing
- For extra bonus points, if you're confident building composer packages that's a plus! 

At this point in time **we're only looking for developers in the UK**. We're a team who predominantly work remotely too, but if you fancy it you can always work from our office at Waterlooville, Hampshire too! 

We pay handsomely for developers so please let us know what you would expect / want as a salary when you get in touch to apply. 

If this sounds like you then why don't you pop our MD (Gareth) an email at hire_me@plannrcrm.com.

### VueJS / Javascript Developer Roles

We're looking for a handful of passionate developers who love the art of craft and enjoy nothing more than creating incredible projects with their own fair hands (and code, obviously!). Our love for Laravel is only surpassed by our love of VueJS and the majority of our tools are built using VueJs as our front-end of choice. 

We're always looking for developers who have the following: 
- A passion for building awesome products
- Experienced with GIT to the point that creating a pull request or dealing with merge conflicts doesn't scare you!
- A minimum of 2 years experience working with VueJS / React / Other
- Experience working with APIs through Axios / Fetch 
- Confident (or keen to learn) front-end / E2E testing libraries
- Experience with TailwindCSS is a plus, but not required

At this point in time **we're only looking for developers in the UK**. We're a team who predominantly work remotely too, but if you fancy it you can always work from our office at Waterlooville, Hampshire too!
